h2. Usage & Options (defaults)

<pre>$('.anythingSlider').anythingSlider({
   easing: "swing",                // Anything other than "linear" or "swing" requires the easing plugin
   autoPlay: true,                 // This turns off the entire FUNCTIONALITY, not just if it starts running or not
   startStopped: false,            // If autoPlay is on, this can force it to start stopped
   delay: 3000,                    // How long between slide transitions in AutoPlay mode
   animationTime: 600,             // How long the slide transition takes
   hashTags: true,                 // Should links change the hashtag in the URL?
   buildNavigation: true,          // If true, builds and list of anchor links to link to each slide
   pauseOnHover: true,             // If true, and autoPlay is enabled, the show will pause on hover
   startText: "Start",             // Start text
   stopText: "Stop",               // Stop text
   navigationFormatter: null       // Advanced Use: details below
});</pre>
	
To use the navigationFormatter function, you must have a function that accepts two parameters, and returns a string of HTML text.
	
* <code>index</code> = integer index (1 based);
* <code>panel</code> = jQuery wrapped LI item this tab references
* Function must return a string of HTML/Text

Here is a sample formatter:

<pre>navigationFormatter: function(index, panel){
	return index + " Panel"; 		// This would have each tab with the text 'X Panel' where X = index
}</pre>
