### Usage

	$('.slider').movingBoxes({ startPanel: 3 });
	
### Keyboard Navigation

There is a file in the /js/ folder called `slider-noplugin-withkeyboard.js` which is the original non-plugin
version of this. It's not as easy to have multiple sliders on the page this way, but it does include 
keyboard navigation. If anyone feels like working on this, moving the keyboard nav into the plugin would 
be awesome.
