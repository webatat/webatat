				<h4>The Value of Design</h4>
				<p>Design is based on the inspiration of past accomplishments. On that foundation, we can build upon those achievements to shape the future. Design is about life — past, present and future — and the learning process that happens between birth and death. It is about community and shared knowledge and experience. It is the passion to build on what we've learned to create something better.</p>

				<h4>About this Site</h4>
				<p>The words "design influences" can be understood as both a plural noun and as subject and verb. The plural noun speaks of those who have come before us and paved the way. The verb speaks of the responsibility of design to lead the way. By understanding where we have come from, we have a better idea of where we are going and, perhaps, where we should be heading.</p>

				<h4>Shaping the Future</h4>
				<p>The <a href="/fluid960gs/">Fluid 960 Grid System</a> templates have been built upon the work of Nathan Smith and his <a href="http://960.gs/">960 Grid System</a> using effects from the <a href="http://www.mootools.net/">Mootools</a> JavaScript library. The idea for building these templates was inspired by Andy Clarke, author of <a href="http://www.transcendingcss.com/">Transcending CSS</a>, who advocates a content-out approach to rapid interactive prototyping, crediting Jason Santa Maria with the <a href="http://www.jasonsantamaria.com/archive/2004/05/24/grey_box_method.php">grey box method</a>.</p>
